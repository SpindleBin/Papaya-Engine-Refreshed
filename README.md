#  Papaya Engine Refreshed
Papaya Engine Refreshed is a Friday Night Funkin' Engine made for hardcoded modifications. Created for the KAVIFUNK Mod to use as a base.

Please open source any modifications you make! Not doing so is not cool, especially since malware can always be passed around in hardcoded mods!

## What is this engine for?
This engine was made as a quick-start for hardcoded modifications to Friday Night Funkin'. This way, you don't have to use the base game or another FNF Engine and be forced
to either fix up the base game, or remove bloat from the other Engines.

### How do I use the engine?
This Engine is NOT made for soft-modding. It is purely for hardcoded modifications to the source code. Now, here's how to use it.

- Select "Use this template" beside the name of the repository.
- Create a new repository using the template.
- Use GitHub Desktop or Git to clone your repository to your device
- Follow this [Guide](build.md).
- Open the Repo in VS:Code and begin modding!

### Can I contribute to the Engine?
Hell yeah you can, just make sure all contributions are made to the Dev branch.

## Support
Discord Server coming soon!

## Q & A
### What do you mean "refreshed"? Where's the original Papaya Engine?
Due to me accidentally losing the original repository, and not having the code locally saved on my computer, I had to recover the entire Engine from another unfinished mod I was using with the engine. Luckily, the engine was recoverable.
### Can I use this as a base for my own FNF Engine?
I can't stop you, but I'd prefer not. I do plan on making a version of this Engine called "Fruitbowl Engine" that implements soft-modding into Papaya Engine.
### Can I use this for my mod?
Yes. Not like I'd be able to stop you if I said no, and why would I say no?
